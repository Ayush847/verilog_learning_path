# 🚀 Verilog Learning Journey

Welcome to my Verilog learning repository! This repo serves as a personal journey and study log where I explore and implement digital logic circuits using **Verilog HDL**. Each module includes:

- ✅ Verilog code implementation
- 🖼️ Circuit diagram (created using [Digital JS](https://github.com/tilk/digital))
- 📈 Waveform simulation (via [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/))

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Learn and solidify the basics of Verilog HDL
- Visually understand how digital circuits work using schematic diagrams
- Simulate and validate logic through waveform analysis

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **[Verilog HDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog)** – Hardware Description Language for digital logic design
- **[EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com/)** – Cloud-based platform for Verilog/VHDL simulation and waveform viewing
- **[Digital JS](https://github.com/tilk/digital)** – Online logic circuit simulator for creating visual diagrams
